# Remediation map

**Package 3.0 (SPEC-3 section 3).** Every known finding in one place: where it
lives, which phase closes it, by what mechanism, and how that is verified.

This replaces the Phase 1b document that was deferred, and it is the artefact
every later package checks itself against. A package is not complete until the
findings assigned to its file are closed with evidence or explicitly deferred
with a reason, and until this file is updated in the same commit.

**Built from source, not from memory.** Enumerated from
[`SECURITY-REVIEW.md`](SECURITY-REVIEW.md) and [`decisions.md`](decisions.md),
then **every open status re-verified against the code on `phase-2-data-layer`**
rather than trusted from the review, which is now several packages old. Where a
source document and a later ADR disagree, both are cited and the superseding one
is marked. SPEC-3's own list was used as a starting point to check against, not
as an inventory to copy.

Two statuses changed as a result of that re-verification, in opposite
directions, and both are called out in context below: **SEC-14 is still live**
(believed closed), and **ADR-024 item 2 is closed** (believed open).

---

## Provenance: how each finding was discovered

SPEC-3 asks for this split to be visible in the artefact rather than asserted in
a report, because it is the argument for the test suite.

The mark records how the finding **became known**, not how it was later proved.
SEC-01 was found by reading and the exploit was demonstrated afterwards; it is
marked **R**, because reading was sufficient to find it.

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **R** | **Read.** Found by reading source. |
| **X** | **Executed.** Would not have been known without running something - a test, a request, a build, a query, a library warning. |

| | Count |
|---|---|
| **R** - found by reading | 29 |
| **X** - found by running | 11 |
| Status *corrections* forced by running (counted under their original mark) | 3 |

**The 11 X findings**, none of which any amount of reading would have produced:

| ID | What running it revealed |
|---|---|
| ADR-015 | `--default-authentication-plugin` was removed in MySQL 8.4; the container crash-looped. The spec prescribed it |
| ADR-013 | The ETL must not use `INSERT IGNORE` - found by a schema test |
| ADR-018 | MySQL does **not** reject mixed-case ENUM values. `_ci` collation canonicalises them silently, which is the opposite of what SPEC-1A assumed |
| ADR-032 | SEC-09 upgraded from inferred to observed - donor PII seen in actual log output |
| ADR-033 | Duplicate Mongoose index declarations - visible only as a boot warning |
| ADR-035 | react-router advisories unreachable - `npm audit` plus a reachability check |
| ADR-036 | The prisma advisory chain has no published fix |
| ADR-037 | The vite exposure is not build-time only, correcting an earlier triage |
| ADR-043 | `set_real_ip_from 172.16.0.0/12` covers the Docker bridge gateway - a live spoofing hole |
| ADR-048 | The limiter keyed IPv6 on the raw address; and `rateLimiters.js` opened Redis on `require`, so any importing process never exited |
| ADR-049 | The api image was built from the developer's `node_modules` |

**The 3 corrections** are the sharper argument, because each overturned a status
that a document already asserted:

| Finding | Was believed | Running it showed |
|---|---|---|
| SEC-14 | Closed - `test:payment` passes | Still live. The test asserts the outcome; the mechanism is a thrown `RangeError` |
| SPEC-1A §8.2 | MySQL rejects mixed-case ENUMs | It canonicalises them. The ETL assumption was inverted (ADR-018) |
| Phase 2 acceptance | `docker compose up` healthy on a correct image | The image carried host `node_modules` (ADR-049) |

The reading review was good: it found 29 real defects including the critical
one, and reading remains the only way to find most of them. What reading cannot
do is distinguish code that is correct from code that merely looks correct.
Every entry in both tables above sat in that gap.

---

## OPEN AND UNASSIGNED

**Six findings have no owning phase.** Listed here, separately from the table, so
they cannot be lost in it. Each needs a decision rather than an implementation.

### U-1. DEF-01 - the licence is undecided and blocks publication
**Source** ADR-020, ADR-029 (ADR-029 is on the unmerged `docs/incident-j1-j6`
branch). **Provenance R.**

ADR-029 records a three-way contradiction in the licence state on `main`. The
GPL-3.0-only change was withdrawn and is not approved. Until this is settled the
repository cannot be published, which makes it a blocker on the stated goal of a
self-hostable OSS release - not a documentation chore. **Needs an owner
decision; no phase claims it.**

### U-2. ADR-023 - `verify_payment` reconciliation was nominated for Phase 3 and SPEC-3 does not mention it
**Source** ADR-023. **Provenance R.**

ADR-023 records that the strongest form of the SEC-01 fix does not trust the
callback's signed `status` at all, but calls PayU server-to-server with the
`txnid` and marks the donation from PayU's own answer. Its status line reads
"recorded as a **Phase 3 candidate**". SPEC-3 does not assign it.

This needs an explicit yes or no. The current fix trusts a signed payload
delivered through the donor's browser, which is a large improvement on trusting
its mere arrival but is not the same as authoritative. If the answer is no, that
should be recorded as a decision rather than left as an unclaimed candidate -
otherwise the next reviewer re-raises it. **Recommend deciding before package
3.5 plans its work, since 3.5 is where it would be built.**

### U-3. ADR-024 item 1 - how a donation legitimately reaches `Cancelled`
**Source** ADR-024. **Provenance R.**

The `Cancelled` payment status is written by `/payment/cancel`, but it is not
established what donor action produces that callback versus an ordinary failure,
and PayU's own vocabulary does not cleanly separate them - a realistic
cancellation arrives as `status=failure` with `unmappedstatus=usercancelled`
(ADR-021). Until it is settled, the meaning of the `Cancelled` enum member is
unclear, which affects the admin filter, the Phase 4 ETL's status mapping, and
any report that counts cancellations. **A product question, not a code task.**

### U-4. BUG-05 - post-payment redirect URLs may not match any SPA route
**Source** PROJECT.md BUG-05. **Provenance R.**

`.env.example` used `/payment/success` and `/payment/failure`; `App.jsx` defines
`/payment-success` and `/payment-failure`. With the example values a paying
donor lands on a blank page. This cannot be closed by reading code: it depends
on **the values actually deployed**, which are in Vercel's environment settings
and have never been confirmed. Neither Phase 3 (backend) nor Phase 5 (frontend)
owns a configuration check. **Needs someone to read the deployed values.**

### U-5. SEC-17 (second half) - `for_ocean_security_review.md` is tracked in the repository root
**Source** SEC-17; ADR-030. **Provenance R.**

It is a 984-line exploit-level vulnerability report, and `git ls-files` confirms
it is tracked at HEAD today. ADR-030 assigns the **history** scrub to Phase 6.
Nothing assigns its **removal from HEAD**, which is the part that matters while
the repository's visibility is in question. The first half of SEC-17
(`Frontend/.env`, also confirmed tracked) falls to Phase 5 with the rest of the
frontend. **Recommend removing from HEAD now rather than waiting for Phase 6;
that is a one-line change and Phase 6 still owns the history.**

### U-6. ADR-036 - the prisma advisory has no published fix and no review trigger
**Source** ADR-036. **Provenance X** (found by `npm audit` against the committed
lockfile). **On the unmerged `docs/incident-j1-j6` branch.**

No published version fixes it; the decision was to monitor. "Monitoring" has no
owner, no cadence and no trigger condition, which in practice means it will be
noticed when someone next runs `npm audit` by accident. **Needs either a review
point (a phase boundary) or an explicit acceptance.**

---

## Findings that changed status during this package

### SEC-14 is NOT closed. A passing test was concealing it.

`verifyHash()` in `routes/payment.js:46-53` guards with a **character**-length
comparison and then decodes as hex:

```js
if (expected.length !== received.length) return false;
return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(expected, 'hex'), Buffer.from(received, 'hex'));
```

A 128-character non-hex value passes the guard and then decodes to **zero
bytes**, because `Buffer.from` stops at the first invalid pair. Verified by
execution:

```
expected chars 128 -> bytes 64
received chars 128 -> bytes 0
THROWS: RangeError: Input buffers must have the same byte length
```

`test/payment-callbacks.test.js:355` sends exactly this (`'z'.repeat(128)`) and
passes, because it asserts the *outcome* - the donation stays `Pending` - and
the outcome is right. The request 500s, the throw is caught by the route's
handler, nothing is written. It fails closed.

**But it fails closed by crashing, not by returning `false`,** and the test
cannot tell those apart. So this is the same shape as ADR-048's wrong-reason
test, in the opposite direction: there the assertion was vacuous, here the
assertion is real but tests one property (no state change) while a second
property (the handler does not throw on unauthenticated input) silently
regressed and stayed regressed.

Not exploitable for payment fraud. It is an unauthenticated remote 500 on a
public endpoint, and it is the finding the review actually raised - "malformed
hash input crashes response verification" - still true.

**Assigned to package 3.5.** Fix: validate `/^[0-9a-f]{128}$/i` before decoding.
Verification: extend the existing test to assert the response status, not only
the donation state.

### ADR-024 item 2 IS closed, and the source document does not say so

ADR-024 records that `/success` replaced `paymentDetails` wholesale, destroying
whatever the webhook had written, whichever arrived second. Closed by
`a2b4556`, merged as `b201818`, and now covered by two tests
(`/success merges payment details instead of replacing them`, `a webhook
followed by /success preserves the webhook data`). **ADR-024 supersedes nothing
here - it is simply older than the fix. Marked closed below.**

---

## Closed findings

| ID | Severity | Finding | Closed by | Verified by | Prov |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-01 | Critical | Failed payment replayable as successful | `264ae25` / merge `ad31074` | `test:payment` 17/17; exploit reproduced before the fix (3/7 -> 7/7 -> 16/16) | **R** |
| SEC-02 | High | Reset code brute-forceable, no attempt cap | `264ae25` / merge `ad31074` | `test:auth` 6/6; cap verified at `auth.js:431,486` | **R** |
| SEC-12 | Medium | No dependency lockfiles committed | `74d6c33` | Both lockfiles tracked; CI now uses `npm ci` | **R** |
| ADR-024 §2 | - | `/success` destroyed webhook `paymentDetails` | `a2b4556` / merge `b201818` | 2 tests in `test:payment` | **R** |
| ADR-045 | - | `controllers/authController.js` took `role` from `req.body` | `476cf00` | File deleted; `grep` shows zero importers | **R** |
| ADR-043 | - | `set_real_ip_from 172.16.0.0/12` covered the Docker bridge | `476cf00` | `test:trust-proxy` 4/4; proven by injection - restoring the block made the spoof believed | **X** |
| ADR-048 | - | Limiter keyed IPv6 on the raw address | `476cf00` | `test:data-layer`; proven by injection | **X** |
| ADR-048 | - | Redis connected on `require`, so importers never exited | `476cf00` | Suite no longer hangs; store is lazy | **X** |
| ADR-049 | - | Image built from the developer's `node_modules` | `e85a173` | `Backend/.dockerignore`; image 1.08GB -> 695MB; clean rebuild healthy | **X** |

**SEC-04 is deliberately absent from this table.** Half of it is closed -
`app.set('trust proxy', 1)` is at `app.js:50` and proven through Nginx. The
limiter store is not wired; `routes/auth.js:19-25` still constructs a default
in-memory limiter. Per ADR-042 the finding stays open until package 3.4 swaps
the import. Reporting it closed on the strength of the store existing is
precisely the error ADR-042 was written to prevent.

## Open findings, by owning package

Phase assignments follow SPEC-3 section 2. "Mechanism" is how it gets fixed;
"Verification" is what proves it.

### Package 3.1 - `routes/categories.js`

| ID | Sev | Finding | Mechanism | Verification | Prov |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-19 | Low | `error: err.message` returned to clients | Generic message to client, detail to server log | Characterisation test asserts the response body carries no `message` | **R** |
| BUG-08 | - | `parseInt(limit)` with no cap or NaN guard (`categories.js:48`) | Clamp to a maximum, default on NaN | Test: `?limit=100000` and `?limit=abc` | **R** |
| ADR-004 | - | Category delete becomes a soft delete - **behaviour change** | `categories.archive()`; `deletedAt` filter | Characterisation test records the current hard-delete behaviour first, then the change is made visibly | **R** |

### Package 3.2 - `routes/donations.js`

| ID | Sev | Finding | Mechanism | Verification | Prov |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-16 | Low | `PUT /donations/:id` writes any `status` string (`donations.js:249,293` - `findByIdAndUpdate`, no `runValidators`) | Repository accepts only enum members; MySQL ENUM rejects the rest | Test writes a junk status and expects rejection | **R** |
| SEC-19 | Low | `err.message` to client | As 3.1 | Characterisation test | **R** |
| BUG-01 | - | `POST /api/donations` can never succeed - builds a document without the required `donorEmail`/`amount` (`donations.js:22-33`) | Decide: supply the fields or delete the endpoint | Characterisation test records the current 400 **as current behaviour**, then the change is visible | **R** |
| BUG-02 | - | `PATCH /:id/status` accepts only lowercase `approved`/`rejected` (`donations.js:289`) while callbacks write `Approved` | Canonical enum casing through the repository | Test asserts both casings resolve correctly; see ADR-018 for the ETL side | **R** |
| BUG-06 | - | `optionalAuth` 401s a guest holding a stale token (`donations.js:7-17`) | Catch the auth failure and fall through to guest | Test: expired token + guest donation succeeds | **R** |
| BUG-08 | - | Unbounded pagination (`donations.js:112,218`) | As 3.1 | As 3.1 | **R** |
| ADR-041 | - | `distinct()` must keep data semantics, not enum semantics | `donations.listStatusesInUse()` | Already tested in `test:data-layer`; route test asserts the endpoint's shape | **R** |
| ADR-003 | - | Deleting a user preserves their donations - **behaviour change** | FK `ON DELETE SET NULL`; `donor.isGuest` distinguishes | Test: delete a donor, donation survives and stays attributable | **R** |

### Package 3.3 - `routes/admin.js`

| ID | Sev | Finding | Mechanism | Verification | Prov |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-08 | Medium | User enumeration (admin-side endpoints) | Generic responses | Test asserts identical responses for known and unknown | **R** |
| SEC-18 | Medium | bcrypt cost 10 (`admin.js:128,220`) | `BCRYPT_COST = 12` via `repositories/users` | Test asserts the stored hash's cost parameter | **R** |
| SEC-19 | Low | `err.message` to client | As 3.1 | Characterisation test | **R** |
| SEC-21 | Low | `POST /admin/users` leaves `isVerified` false, then `auth.js:242-245` silently auto-verifies (`admin.js:131-139` confirmed: no `isVerified` set) | Set `isVerified: true` explicitly; scope or remove the auto-verify branch (branch itself is 3.4) | Test: admin-created account is verified at creation, and the legacy branch does not fire | **R** |
| BUG-03 | - | Dashboard "approved" counter always 0 - `countDocuments({status:"approved"})` at `admin.js:20` | Canonical casing; follows BUG-02 | Test: seed an `Approved` donation, expect the tile to count it | **R** |
| BUG-04 | - | Retention purge has never run - Vercel cron hits `/api/admin/cleanup/trigger` behind `adminAuth` (`Backend/vercel.json:15-20`) | Phase 2's `services/scheduler.js` replaces it; remove the dead cron declaration | Scheduler tests already pass; assert the endpoint is gone or authenticated by shared secret | **R** |
| BUG-08 | - | Unbounded pagination (`admin.js:80`) | As 3.1 | As 3.1 | **R** |

### Package 3.4 - `routes/auth.js` + `middleware/` + seam

| ID | Sev | Finding | Mechanism | Verification | Prov |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SEC-04** | **High** | **Rate limiting non-functional** - `routes/auth.js:19-25` builds a default in-memory limiter | Wire `config/rateLimiters.js`. **This is what closes the finding** (ADR-042) | `test:auth` unchanged; assert the Redis store is in use | **R** |
| **SEC-05** | **High** | `isActive` never enforced and tokens cannot be revoked - confirmed: the flag exists on the model and `admin.js:196` toggles it, but **no route or middleware reads it**, and `tokenVersion` does not exist in `routes/`, `middleware/` or `models/` | Check `isActive` at both login steps and in both middlewares; `tokenVersion` on the token, incremented by `setPassword`/`setActive` | Test: disable an account, existing token rejected, login refused | **R** |
| **SEC-03** | **High** | NoSQL operator injection - **12+ `findOne({ email })` call sites, no `String()` coercion anywhere in `routes/` or `middleware/`** | Parameterised SQL removes the class; repositories coerce and lowercase | Test posts `{"email":{"$ne":null}}` and expects no match | **R** |
| SEC-08 | Medium | User enumeration on five endpoints | Generic responses | Test asserts identical responses | **R** |
| SEC-10 | Medium | Password policy absent in two places, inconsistent elsewhere | One shared validator across all five paths | Test each path with a weak password | **R** |
| SEC-13 | Medium | OTPs and reset codes stored in plaintext - confirmed at `auth.js:385` (`user.resetPasswordCode = verificationCode`) | Repositories store sha256 (`users.setResetCode`) | Test: read the row, assert no plaintext code | **R** |
| SEC-18 | Medium | bcrypt cost 10 (`auth.js:57,506,533`) | `BCRYPT_COST = 12` | As 3.3 | **R** |
| SEC-19 | Low | `err.message` to client | As 3.1 | Characterisation test | **R** |
| ADR-034 | - | A correct code at `/verify` must NOT clear the attempt counter | `users.verifyResetCode` deliberately does not reset | Already asserted in `test:auth` and `test:data-layer`; must stay true | **R** |
| ADR-033 | - | Duplicate index declarations in the Mongoose models | Moot once the models go (3.6); must not be reintroduced in the Prisma schema | Drift gate; boot logs free of the Mongoose duplicate-index warning | **X** |
| SEC-09 | Medium | Donor PII written to application logs | Strip PII; level-aware logger | Assert no PII in captured log output | **R** (ADR-032 upgraded the evidence to observed - **X**) |

### Package 3.5 - `routes/payment.js` + remaining seam

| ID | Sev | Finding | Mechanism | Verification | Prov |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SEC-14** | Medium | **Still live.** Malformed hash throws `RangeError` - char-length guard, byte-length decode (`payment.js:51-52`) | Validate `/^[0-9a-f]{128}$/i` before decoding | Extend `payment-callbacks.test.js:355` to assert the response status, not only the donation state | **R**, re-opened by **X** |
| SEC-06 | Medium | Unauthenticated donor PII via `GET /payment/status/:txnid` - confirmed: no auth middleware at `payment.js:601` | Authenticate; random transaction ids | Test: unauthenticated request returns no PII | **R** |
| SEC-07 | Medium | Donation attribution forgery - `userId` is destructured from `req.body` at `payment.js:99` and written at `:134` | Take the user from the token, never the body | Test: post a forged `userId`, assert it is ignored | **R** |
| SEC-11 | Medium | Unauthenticated write endpoints allow storage/email flooding | `paymentInitiateLimiter` (built in Phase 2, unwired); stale-`Pending` sweep | Test the limiter fires; scheduler test for the sweep | **R** |
| SEC-19 | Low | `details: error.message` at `payment.js:443,475` | Generic message | Characterisation test | **R** |
| ADR-012 / ADR-026 | - | SEC-01 idempotency is a non-atomic read-then-write. **ADR-026 supersedes ADR-012's conclusion**: the `mihpayid` UNIQUE index is integrity, NOT the replay defence | Wrap the callback in `withTransaction` (SPEC-3 §4.3) | Concurrent-callback test | **R** |
| ADR-024 §3 / ADR-026 / ADR-027 | - | No security decision may rest on an unsigned field; unsigned text must be escaped per sink | Keep the `verifyHash` banner; escape at each sink, not at ingest | Test asserts `unmappedstatus` cannot drive the decision | **R** |
| SPEC-3 §4.6 | - | Alternate-case parser fallbacks (`.AMOUNT`, `.STATUS`, `udf_4`, `udf[4]`) | Delete them; keep the banner comment | Tests unchanged - they are unreachable today | **R** |

### Package 3.6 - Mongoose removal

Exit criteria are SPEC-3 section 7. The map's own condition: every Phase 3
finding above is closed or explicitly deferred, and SEC-04 is reported closed
with its wiring commit, reversing the Phase 2 report.

| ID | Finding | Mechanism | Verification | Prov |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ADR-047 | `docker-compose.legacy-mongo.yml` exists only while `config/db.js` does | Delete both | Plain `docker compose up`, four healthy, no override | **R** |

---

## Deferred to later phases

### Phase 4 - ETL and cutover

| ID | Finding / constraint | Prov |
|---|---|---|
| ADR-013 | The ETL must never use `INSERT IGNORE` / `UPDATE IGNORE` | **X** (found by a schema test) |
| ADR-018 | The ETL must count mixed-case status values before insert; supersedes SPEC-1A's assumption that MySQL rejects them - it does not, `_ci` collation canonicalises silently | **X** |
| ADR-022 | The ETL must re-check strict SQL mode in its own preflight | **R** |
| ADR-025 | `gateway_status` will be NULL for the entire paid population at cutover | **R** |
| ADR-031 | The rollback window closes at the first real donation into MySQL | **R** |
| J3 | Admin account enumeration, the `Password@123` check, the `PendingSignup` TTL index check. **Blocked on a dedicated read-only Atlas user.** SPEC-3 §8 requires flagging again when 3.4 completes | **R** |
| - | A restored production snapshot to rehearse the ETL against. Same credential dependency | **R** |

### Phase 5 - frontend and dependencies

| ID | Sev | Finding | Prov |
|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-15 | Medium | JWT in `localStorage` (confirmed at `LoginPage.jsx:51,81`, `SignupPage.jsx:75`) | **R** |
| SEC-17 | Low | `Frontend/.env` is tracked (confirmed by `git ls-files`) | **R** |
| SEC-20 | Low | `/tailwind-test` and `/button-showcase` routed in production (`App.jsx:162-163`) | **R** |
| BUG-07 | - | Dead and mismatched frontend API methods | **R** |
| ADR-035 | - | `react-router-dom@7` major; the advisories themselves are unreachable | **X** (`npm audit` + reachability check) |
| ADR-037 | - | `vite` exposure restated accurately - not build-time only | **X** |

### Phase 6 - release

| ID | Finding | Prov |
|---|---|---|
| ADR-030 | History scrub, expanded scope | **R** |
| DEF-01 | Licence - **but see U-1: it blocks publication and has no owner today** | **R** |

---

## Source conflicts and supersessions

Recorded because SPEC-3 section 3 asks for both sides to be cited rather than
silently reconciled.

| Topic | Older source says | Superseded by | Which wins |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mihpayid` UNIQUE index | SPEC-1A §5.6 and ADR-012: it is the SEC-01 replay defence | **ADR-026** | ADR-026. `mihpayid` is unsigned and attacker-mutable; the index is a data-integrity control only. This is the one wrong rationale that reached a merged branch (ADR-048) |
| Mixed-case ENUM values | SPEC-1A §8.2: MySQL will reject them on load | **ADR-013, ADR-018** | ADR-013/018. `_ci` collation canonicalises `'approved'` to `'Approved'` silently, so the ETL must count them beforehand |
| `--default-authentication-plugin` | SPEC-1A §3.3 prescribes it | **ADR-015** | ADR-015. Removed in MySQL 8.4; the container crash-loops |
| `api`/`nginx` profile gating | ADR-006: gated, cannot start | **ADR-006 amendment (AA2)** | The amendment. Gating removed; acceptance is four healthy services **with the legacy-mongo override** |
| SEC-14 | Remediation plan lists it under "next sprint", and `test:payment` passes | **This document** | Still live. The test asserts the outcome, not the mechanism |
| ADR-024 item 2 | Recorded as an open Phase 3 question | **`a2b4556` / `b201818`** | Closed. The fix postdates the ADR |
| SEC-04 | Remediation plan: "trust proxy + Redis store" as one item | **ADR-042** | Split. `trust proxy` is closed and proven; the store is built but unwired, so the finding is open until 3.4 |
| SEC-09 | Review inferred it from the code | **ADR-032** | ADR-032. Upgraded to observed; the finding itself is unchanged |

---

## Counts

| State | Count | Rows |
|---|---|---|
| Closed | 9 | - |
| Open, assigned to a Phase 3 package | 38 | 3.1: 3, 3.2: 8, 3.3: 7, 3.4: 11, 3.5: 8, 3.6: 1 |
| Open, assigned to Phase 4 / 5 / 6 | 14 | P4: 7, P5: 6, P6: 1 |
| **Open and unassigned** | **6** | U-1 .. U-6 |

These are ROW counts, not distinct findings. An item like SEC-19 that spans five
route files appears five times, once per owning package - deliberate, because
each is a separate unit of work with separate verification, and a single row
would let four of the five be forgotten.

DEF-01 appears as U-1 and is cross-referenced from Phase 6; it is counted once,
under unassigned, because Phase 6 owning the release does not make Phase 6 the
owner of the decision.
